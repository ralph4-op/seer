### The wallet_gen library is intended to generate minimalistic types for monero, zcash, bitcoin and ethereum as well as other wallets we add in the future. 
##### What it's not intended to do, 
###### - listen in on the network.
###### - activitely finance gas fee's or to have any smartcontracts inside of them or templates for them.
###### - store keys, only generates them, addresses, and types for signing to the network not the server or blockchain itself.
