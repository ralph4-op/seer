## Roadmap

### Phase 1 – Foundation (Social + Escrow)
- Posts stored on **IPFS** for free expression.  
- Typing **$** links a wallet and creates an **escrow agreement** via digital signatures (not on-chain).  
- Posts with escrow receive a **verification badge**, signaling trust.  
- Trade digital goods, services, or physical items.  
- Comment-based offers allow peer-to-peer negotiations (e.g. *“I’ll buy that for 50.”*).  
- **Blockchain role:** domains + contract discovery.  

---

### Phase 2 – Scaling & Long-Term Agreements
- Support for larger content (videos, games, repos) on **IPFS**.  
- **Long-term contracts** managed off-chain via signatures, optionally anchored in blockchain registries.  
- **Self-hosting nodes** replicate content, increasing resilience and censorship resistance.  

---

### Phase 3 – Assets & Finance Layer
- Users can issue **publicly tradable digital assets**.  
- Blockchain ensures asset permanence and interoperability.  
- Everyday escrows, offers, and posts remain efficient via **signatures + IPFS**.
